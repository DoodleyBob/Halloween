                <p> The Headless Horseman is an archetype of mythical figure that has appeared in folklore around Europe
                     since the Middle Ages.[1] The figures are traditionally depicted as riders upon horseback who are missing
                      their heads. These myths have since inspired a number of stories and characters in popular culture,
                       including The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.

                <h2> HISTORY OF HALLOWEEN</h2>

                <p> Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and Halloween 2024 will occur on Thursday,
                     October 31. The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would
                      light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated
                       November 1 as a time to honor all saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated some of the traditions of
                        Samhain. The evening before was known as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over time, Halloween
                         evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings,
                          donning costumes and eating treats.
